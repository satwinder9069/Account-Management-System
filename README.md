# üè¶ Bank Account Management System - Java OOP Implementation
## Task 5 : Bank Account Simulation
A clean, console-based banking system that demonstrates solid OOP design with an immutable Transaction model, a clear service layer, and a simple CLI. It supports account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, account summaries, and printable statements.

---
## ‚ö°Features
- üí≥ Account Management: Create new accounts with unique 12-digit account numbers.
- üí∞ Deposit Operations: Secure money deposits with real-time transaction logging.
- üí∏ Withdrawal Operations: Controlled withdrawals with balance validation and overdraft protection.
- üîÑ Money Transfers: Inter-account transfers with complete audit trails and validation.
- üìä Transaction History: Detailed transaction records with timestamps and descriptions.
- üîç Account Lookup: Find and view account details instantly with comprehensive statements.
- üìã Account Summaries: Overview of all accounts with transaction counts and balances.
- üõ°Ô∏è Data Integrity: Immutable transaction records and comprehensive input validation.
- üéØ User Experience: Intuitive console-based interface with clear error messages.

  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Account.java          # Core account class with transaction management
  
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Transaction.java     # Immutable transaction records
  
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bank.java            # Bank management system with account operations
  
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BankSimulation.java  # Main CLI loop

## üß± Architecture and Flow
- **BankSimulation** (CLI) ‚Üí Reads input, Shows menu
- **BankService** (use-cases) ‚Üí The "manager" that decides what to do. It tells the Bank to perform operations.
- **Bank** (accounts registry) ‚Üí Stores all accounts, creates account numbers, and does banking operations.
- **Account** (domain model) ‚Üí Represents a single bank account. It changes the balance and keeps a history of transactions.
- **Transaction** (value object) ‚Üí A record of one operation (like deposit/withdraw). It cannot be changed after creation (immutable).

## üß© Class Responsibilities
- Transaction
    - Immutable record: Type (DEPOSIT/WITHDRAWAL), amount, timestamp, balanceAfter, description.
    - All fields final, no setters. Friendly toString for statements.

- Account
    - Fields: accountNumber, accountHolder, balance, List<Transaction> history, overdraftLimit (default 100.0; not yet used in checks).
    - Methods: deposit(amount, desc), withdraw(amount, desc), getBalance(), getTransactions() [defensive copy], printTransactionHistory().
    - Validations: amount must be positive; withdrawals check sufficient balance.

- Bank
    - Stores accounts (List<Account>).
    - Generates unique account numbers: PREFIX="1234", TOTAL_LENGTH=12.
    - Operations: createAccount, findAccount, deposit, withdraw, transfer, getAccountDetails, getAllAccountsSummary.
      
- BankService
    - CLI-facing orchestration. Reads input, calls Bank methods.
    - Methods: createNewAccount, depositMoney, withdrawMoney, transferMoney, viewAccountDetails, viewAllAccounts.

- BankSimulation
    - Main loop and menu. Instantiates Bank and BankService, seeds a few sample accounts, handles exceptions, and keeps the app running.

## üîÑ Program Flow (per menu option)
**1. Create New Account**
    -> BankService.createNewAccount()
    -> Bank.createAccount(holder, initialDeposit)
    -> Account is created; initial deposit recorded as first Transaction.

**2. Deposit Money**

    -> BankService.depositMoney()
    -> Bank.deposit(accountNumber, amount, description)
    -> Account.deposit() updates balance and appends Transaction.

**3. Withdraw Money**

    -> BankService.withdrawMoney()
    -> Bank.withdraw(accountNumber, amount, description)
    -> Account.withdraw() validates funds, updates balance, and appends Transaction.

**4. Transfer Money**

    -> BankService.transferMoney()
    -> Bank.transfer(from, to, amount, description)
    -> Source: withdraw("Transfer to ...")
    -> Destination: deposit("Transferred from ...")
    -> Two Transactions are written (one per account).

**5. View Account Details**

    -> BankService.viewAccountDetails()
    -> Bank.getAccountDetails(accountNumber)
    -> Prints Account.toString() + Account.printTransactionHistory().

**6. View All Accounts**

    -> BankService.viewAllAccounts()
    -> Bank.getAllAccountsSummary() prints a compact table.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Design Choices
- ‚òï Java 11+
- OOP: Encapsulation, composition, immutability
- Collections:
    - Account history ‚Üí ArrayList (preserves chronological order ‚è≥)
    - Bank accounts ‚Üí ArrayList (simple). For O(1) lookups, a Map can be introduced later.
- Errors: 
   - IllegalArgumentException for bad input ‚ùå 
   - IllegalStateException can be used for business rule failures. ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Currency: double for learning purposes üéì (consider BigDecimal in real apps).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. üì• Clone or Download the Project
```
git clone https://github.com/satwinder9069/Account-Management-System.git
cd task5_BankAccSimulation
```
2. ‚öôÔ∏è Compile the Java Files
(Make sure you‚Äôre in the task5_BankAccSimulation folder)
```
javac *.java
```
3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application
```
java BankSimulation
```

4. üíª Sample Output:
```
State Bank of Mine
========================================
1. Create New Account
2. Deposit Money
3. Withdraw Money
4. Transfer Money

6. View All Accounts
7. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter account holder name: Rohan Kumar

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
## üîç Validation Rules (current behavior)
- Deposit: amount must be positive (negative amounts rejected)
- Withdraw: amount must be positive and ‚â§ current balance
- Transfer: both accounts must exist; source must have sufficient funds
- Account holder name required (collected in CLI)
- Unknown account numbers ‚Üí ‚ÄúAccount not found‚Äù error
- CLI catches exceptions and keeps the app running

## üîß Public API (BankService)
```
void createNewAccount();
void depositMoney();
void withdrawMoney();
void transferMoney();
void viewAccountDetails();
void viewAllAccounts();
```
Internally delegates to:
```
// Bank
Account createAccount(String holder, double initialDeposit);
Account findAccount(String accountNumber);
void deposit(String accountNumber, double amount, String description);
void withdraw(String accountNumber, double amount, String description);
void transfer(String fromAccount, String toAccount, double amount, String description);
void getAccountDetails(String accountNumber);
void getAllAccountsSummary();
```
